### What I learned

I wanted to try out a new library for charts. I used chartjs for this case. It was challenging at first. I came to know about many terms related to charts such as different types of charts, gird, ticks, legend, label, tooltip and so on. I also got to be familiar with tree-shaking that chartjs uses.
The best takeaway is that know I how to approach to a new library and be familiar with it.

### Continued development

Next I will be focusing on building other types of charts such as doughnut, line, radar etc. Once I'm comfortable with these I want to try out my bubble and scatter chart. These things looks very exciting to work on.
